The main objective of this project is to simulate the operation of a store with several service counters. Customers arrive at the store and are directed to the most suitable service counter. Each service counter has a queue of waiting customers, and the service is done following the FIFO approach - the first customer to arrive is the first to be served.

This project helps to better understand how queues work in practice and how they can be used to solve real-world problems, such as managing the flow of customers in a store. In addition, it also allows practicing object-oriented programming, through the use of classes to represent the ADTs and the queues.
